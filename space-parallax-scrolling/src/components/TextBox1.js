      <h3>The Milky Way</h3>
      <p>
        The Milky Way is a huge collection of stars, dust and gas. It’s called a
        spiral galaxy because if you could view it from the top or bottom, it
        would look like a spinning pinwheel. The Sun is located on one of the
        spiral arms, about 25,000 light-years away from the center of the
        galaxy. Even if you could travel at the speed of light (300,000
        kilometers, or 186,000 miles, per second), it would take you about
        25,000 years to reach the middle of the Milky Way.
